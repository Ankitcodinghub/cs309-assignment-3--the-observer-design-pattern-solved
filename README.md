Executive Summary

In this lab exercise, you will gain experience in using the Observer design pattern, in this case in the specific context of Java‚Äôs implementation of the Observer design pattern in Swing.

To complete this assignment, you‚Äôre going to need to refactor original code to meet our requirements.

The Observer Pattern and Swing

Game Rules:

Picture 1:

Picture 2:

Picture 3:

This is a pretty simple game with only three type of balls (red, blue and white).

Before starting the game, user can click ADD button to add red or blue balls. The initial score of this game is 100. Score would minus 10 while adding a red ball, plus 30 while adding a blue ball. All red and blue balls can be seen before the game starts. (Picture 1)

When click start button, the game starts while two white ball appears, at the same time all three buttons in game frame can not be clicked anymore. (Picture 2)

Score will continuously decrease after the game starts. User could control balls through the keyboard. Only ball that intersects with the white ball can be seen.

The rules of keyboard:

Balls Key to Action

White ball a: xSpeed becomes -8 d: xSpeed becomes 8 w: ySpeed becomes -8 s: ySpeed becomes 8

Red ball a: xSpeed becomes a negative random int d: xSpeed becomes a positive random int w: ySpeed becomes a negative random int s: ySpeed becomes a positive random int

Blue ball All keys: change the direction of xSpeed, ySpeed respectively

WhiteRandom ball do not controlled by keyboard

If user click stop button, the game will terminate. Score will be calculated by the amount of red and blue balls that white ball has caught. Score would plus 80 with each read ball and minus 80 with each blue ball. (Picture 3)

Task 1 (50 points)

So this isn‚Äôt terrible code, and it‚Äôs actually quite common to see. But it‚Äôs not at all a real implementation of the observer pattern. The problem here is that the observed object is basically observing itself and then dispatching its observations to the clients, instead of letting those clients take care of their own observations.

First, let‚Äôs create a new module named observer . Make a copy of the code you have in original inside of the src folder in observer . Now let‚Äôs think about the changes we want to make.

To be consistent with the Observer pattern, each of the interested components should register itself to receive the keyboard‚Äôs events. The question is, who is really the ‚Äúclient‚Äù in this interaction? If you answered ‚Äù The Balls!‚Äù you would be exactly correct.

Hints

First, let‚Äôs refactor our design. Provide a new class diagram depicting a design that allows each of the interested observers to register themselves to receive the keyboard‚Äôs events.

There‚Äôs a catch, though. I had to refactor the four type of balls into four different extensions of the same abstract base class Ball (I called them RedBall , WhiteBall , WhiteRandomBall and BlueBall

So, we can regard the MainPanel class as the implement class of Subject class, and regard three type of Ball classes ( RedBall , WhiteBall and Blueball ) that extends the Ball as the observer.

So in the ‚ÄúSubject‚Äù class, you should design methods like registerObserver() , notifyObservers() , removeObserver() . On the whole, no matter how you design your project,

you should guarantee that, when you press the keyboard, it will notice the three ball classes and finally the xSpeed and ySpeed of three type of ball classes would be changed accordingly.

Subject Observer

MainPanel RedBall, WhiteBall, BlueBall

registerObserver(), notifyObservers(), removeObserver() update()

To do

All right, now fix the code to observer pattern to decouple the complex code in public void keyPressed(KeyEvent keyEvent) . Notice that do not change any rules of the game we have

declared.

Task 2 Ôºà50 pointsÔºâ

It actually is. It can be succinctly described by the fact that the WhiteBallRandom doesn‚Äôt have to know anything about the existence of the BlueBall and RedBall at all! Fantastic.

Adding New Rules:

To make the game more interesting, adding news rules based on original rules:

When WhiteRandomBall intersect with RedBall or BlueBall , it is visible, otherwise it is not visible Like:

Hints and To do

According to the rules declared above, we know WhiteBallRandom should notify its location to BlueBall and RedBall when it moves, then the instance of BlueBall and the RedBall can update their private boolean visible; attribute automatically when the WhiteBallRandom is intersected with them.

When notice whiteBallRandom‚Äôs location to BlueBall and RedBall.

Subject Observer

WhiteBallRandom BlueBall, RedBall

registerObserver(), notifyObservers(), removeObserver() update()

Other Requirements:

1. The program can run, and the KeyEvent can work.

2. Red and Blue balls are visible only when intersected with WhiteBallRandom.

3. When restart game, make sure that all red and blue balls are removed from MainPanel.

4. When restart game, make sure that all red and blue balls are removed from PaintingBallList.

5. When restart game, make sure that all red and blue balls are removed from all observer List in both two subject.

Design a Subject class like:

What to Submit

Compress all those files into one folder. At the top level of the archive, I want two things to appear:

Task 1 and 2 should to be implemented in the same module.

Each java file should not have any package declaration

For example, if I were to turn in my current files, my directory would unpack like the following:

Ball.java

BlueBall.java

RedBall.java

WhiteBall.java

WhiteBallRandom.java

Subject.java

ButtonPanel.java

MainPanel.java

MainFrame.java Main.java
